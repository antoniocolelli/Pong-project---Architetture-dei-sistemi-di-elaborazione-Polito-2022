# Components used
* Hardware Debugger
* LandTiger board https://os.mbed.com/users/wim/notebook/landtiger-baseboard/
# Usage
Download Keil µVision IDE http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/ .
There are two possible ways to use it:

* Software emulation
* Hardware execution (directly on the board)
## Software emulation
- Clone the repository and open the project with Keil µVision
- Click on "Options for Target - Debug" and then "Use simulator"
- Click on "Run"
- Through the debugger, you can interact with the simulated system
## Execution on the board
- Clone the repository and open the project with Keil µVision
- Click on "Options for Target - Debug" and then "Use <debugger>"
- Load the source code onto the board through Keil
- Click on "Run"
# Description
For a detailed description of the project, please refer to the following link: https://github.com/antoniocolelli/Pong-project---Architetture-dei-sistemi-di-elaborazione-Polito-2022/blob/master/extra_points_request_2022.pdf

# Demo
The video demo shows the game running on a simulator of the Land Tiger board, which results in a lower execution speed compared to the actual board.
